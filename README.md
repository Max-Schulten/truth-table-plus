# Truth Table+ for Obsidian.md
---
Allows users to create autofilled truth tables for quick note taking in logic-related fields.

# Instructions 
---
You can access Truth Table+ from the command pallete under 'Truth Table+: Generate truth table'. This will open a modal which will prompt you for a logical expression and a list of variables used in the logical expression. Be sure to use JS logic operators such as && or ||. When inputted, Truth Table+ will generate a truth table with the appropriate values in your current editor tab.
